        Water conservation is the careful use and preservation of the water supply, including the quantity and quality of water utilized. 
        Water is an essential asset for the nourishment of all life. The fundamental demand for all activities appropriate for local use to the agricultural industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the regularly expanding weight of the human population, there has been serious tension on water resources. 
        Negligence of customary water bodies like tanks and lakes, unpredictable abuse of groundwater, and incorrect preservation of surface water systems have bothered the issue. 
        Still further and is undoubtedly going to grow in the years to come.

        There are various approaches to making your water last nowadays. One simple yet often disregarded strategy to cut your water bill is to use your water twice. 
        Unlike electricity, you can reuse water again and again. That's the idea of water conservation.

    <span class="second"><em>Key Facts about our water:</em></span>
    <p>Water is the most important natural resource that living things need. But at the same time, it has also been misused and wasted. 
        To better grasp the full significance of water conservation, take a look at the few yet key facts about water:
        <ul>
            <li>The average adult human body comprises 50-65 percent of water. 
                They are averaging around 57-60 percent. Infants have a higher percentage. 
                Often around 75-78% water, dropping to 65% by one year.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Earth has a limited amount of water. 
                The water we have now is all we get, recycled repeatedly. 
                The water cycle can help you understand this condition.
            </li>
            <li>
                Water is the basic demand for every food. It grows our fruits and vegetable, and each livestock consumes it.
            </li>
            <li>
                A plant's life is dependent on water. Plants help the ecosystem and produce the oxygen necessary to keep us healthy. 
                Trees are generally used for housing, paper, and much more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ninety-seven percent (97%) of all water on Earth is saltwater- which is not suitable for drinking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only three percent (3%) of water on Earth is freshwater. Only 0.5% is available and is suitable for drinking.

            </li>
            <li>
                The other 2.5% of freshwater is found in glaciers, ice caps, the atmosphere, soil, or under the Earth's surface or is too polluted for consumption.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <span class="third">What are the Water-Related Problems?</span>
        <img class="one" src="assets/image/drought.jpeg" alt="Drought">

        <p>
            The main problems with water are water shortage, shortages of clean water, and waterborne diseases. 
            A lack of safe water caused 80% of all deaths worldwide. 
            More than 5 million people die yearly from water-related diseases such as hepatitis A, dysentery, and severe diarrhea.
        </p>
        <p>
            Approximately 900 million to 1.1 billion people worldwide lack clean drinking water, and 2.4 billion lack basic sanitation. 
            Water demand is increasing at a rate faster than population growth. Over the past 70 years, while the world's population has tripled, water demand has increased sixfold. 
            The United Nations estimates that in 2025 that 5 billion of the world's 8 billion people will live in areas where water is scarce. 
            Many people will have difficulty accessing enough water to meet their basic needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Increasing populations, growing agriculture, industrialization, and high living standards have boosted water demand.</b>
            All this while drought, overuse, and pollution have decreased the supplies. To make up for this shortfall, water is often taken from lakes, rivers, and wetlands, causing serious environmental damage. 
            A 2003 United Nations report states, "Across the globe, groundwater is being depleted by the demands of megacities and agriculture, while fertilizer runoff and pollution are threatening water quality and public health."
        </p>
        <p>
            Every week, there are alarming predictions about water, such as disease, crop disasters, starvation, famines, and war. 
            <b>Safe drinking water and sanitation are major challenges in many developing countries,</b>, from shanty towns and areas to poor urban cities. 
            At least in rural areas, the poor can dig wells and take care of sanitation in their fields. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <span class="third">Conservation</span>
    <p>
    Earth has a finite amount of fresh, usable water.
    Fortunately, water is naturally recycled (collected, cleansed, and distributed) through the hydrologic cycle.
    Humans have developed the technology to speed this process.
    However, because of diverse factors (drought, flood, population growth, contamination, etc.) water supplies may not adequately meet a community’s needs.
    Conservation of water can ensure that supplies of fresh water will be available for everyone, today and tomorrow.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        Water conservation involves changing habits.
        Since many of these habits have evolved over a lifetime, they can prove difficult to alter. 
        People can become active in conserving water by starting simply, then gradually taking more advanced steps to reduce water consumption. 
        The simplest habits involve turning off water whenever it is not being used. 
        When water is needed for rinsing dishes, it can be held in a sink rather than allowing it to flow unused down the drain
    
    </p>
    <p>
        An individual may simply use less water. For example, some people use a hose to “sweep” sidewalks, when a broom works well. 
        People can shorten their shower times or reduce the amount of water they use when bathing.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        Other conservation methods may initially require more effort and funds, but in the long run will save money and resources. For example, households can install low-flow showerheads with smaller holes that reduce water flow and increase pressure. 
        A capped bottle weighted with stones takes up space in a toilet tank, reducing the amount of water available to flush down the drain.
