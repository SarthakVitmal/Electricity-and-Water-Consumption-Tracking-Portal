                With todayâ€™s global energy crisis resulting in high prices and shortages that are hurting consumers, 
                businesses and entire economies, it has never been more important to use energy more wisely. 
                We can do this through simple changes in behaviour and habits to consume less energy in our daily activities. 
                We can also save energy by investing in more energy efficient products that reduce both our energy bills and our environmental footprint.
