## Features 
1.User Authentication: This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the EcoTrack platform. By requiring users to log in with their credentials, such as a username and password, we maintain the security and privacy of their data.

2. Server Side Validation: Server-side validation is implemented to ensure that the data submitted by users is accurate, consistent, and safe. This validation process occurs on the server, providing an additional layer of security to prevent malicious or erroneous data from being processed.
