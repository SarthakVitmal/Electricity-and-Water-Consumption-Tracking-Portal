## Features 
1.User Authentication: This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the EcoTrack platform. By requiring users to log in with their credentials, such as a username and password, we maintain the security and privacy of their data.

2. Server Side Validation: Server-side validation is implemented to ensure that the data submitted by users is accurate, consistent, and safe. This validation process occurs on the server, providing an additional layer of security to prevent malicious or erroneous data from being processed.


3. Secure Password Storage using Hashing: Passwords are securely stored using hashing techniques, which convert the password into a unique, irreversible string of characters. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, passwords cannot be easily decrypted or accessed by unauthorized parties.


4. Tracking Users' Water and Electricity Usage: EcoTrack allows users to monitor and track their water and electricity consumption over time. By providing insightful data and visualizations, users can gain a better understanding of their usage patterns and identify areas for improvement.


5. Providing Solutions to Users Based on Their Water and Electricity Consumption: Based on the data collected from users' consumption patterns, EcoTrack offers personalized recommendations and solutions to help users reduce their water and electricity usage. These solutions may include tips for conservation, suggestions for more energy-efficient appliances, or strategies for optimizing usage habits.
